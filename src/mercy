3. Ran decodify against found string

[+] Decoded from Base64 : It's annoying, but we repeat this over and over again: cyber hygiene is extremely important. Please stop setting silly passwords that will get cracked with any decent password list.

Once, we found the password "password", quite literally sticking on a post-it in front of an employee's desk! As silly as it may be, the employee pleaded for mercy when we threatened to fire her.
No fluffy bunnies for those who set insecure passwords and endanger the enterprise.

Hi! Congratulations on being able to root MERCY.

The author feels bittersweet about this box. On one hand, it was a box designed as a dedication to the sufferance put through by the Offensive Security team for PWK. I thought I would pay it forward by creating a vulnerable machine too. This is not meant to be a particularly difficult machine, but is meant to bring you through a good number of enumerative steps through a variety of techniques.

The author would also like to thank a great friend who he always teases as "plead for mercy". She has been awesome. The author, in particular, appreciates her great heart, candour, and her willingness to listen to the author's rants and troubles. The author will stay forever grateful for her presence. She never needed to be this friendly to the author.

The author, as "plead for mercy" knows, is terrible at any sort of dedication or gifting, and so the best the author could do, I guess, is a little present, which explains the hostname of this box. (You might also have been pleading for mercy trying to root this box, considering its design.)

You'll always be remembered, "plead for mercy", and Offensive Security, for making me plead for mercy!

Congratulations, once again, for you TRIED HARDER!

Regards,
The Author
