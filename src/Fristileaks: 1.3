Yo EZ,

I made it possible for you to do some automated checks, 
but I did only allow you access to /usr/bin/* system binaries. I did
however copy a few extra often needed commands to my 
homedir: chmod, df, cat, echo, ps, grep, egrep so you can use those
from /home/admin/

Don't forget to specify the full path for each binary!

Just put a file called "runthis" in /tmp/, each line one command. The 
output goes to the file "cronresult" in /tmp/. It should 
run every minute with my account privileges.
