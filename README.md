# vulnhubdb
Updated: 1/8/2021. You ever re-read your old programming and go "WHAT was I thinking..." Plz dont judge me on my past work.

This was designed to be a "knowledge base" for boxes i've done on vulnhub. This also includes the script vulnhubdb.py to search for strings by section, or you may follow the interactive menu to search for information.

Alternatively, You may just pull down the database and sort through them manually as they are just text files seperated by [*]. <--- This was used to parse sections in the files.
